# ACDT-G30-Raspberry-pi-Pi-Car-Pro-codes
Codes for our rapsberry pi project using Pi Car Pro as our robot. Including final codes and some codes used in the developing stages.
The final demonstration code is 888.py. To run this code use should activate virtual environment (venv) to run the code. For example, for our raspberry pi we used  source ~/stt_venv/bin/activate to activate the venv in our pi. The code should be ran in the virtual environent.
The final code for longer version with the batteries is 998.py, and the final longer version with the charger connected is 999.py. These also require to activate the virtual environment.
Also for the code that is for the raspberry pi robot, it requires correct pin numbers and files for the activation
Moreover for the running of OpenAI STT you need OpenAI key since it is a paid service. We can't upload the key on to the Github since it is too dangerous, so to run the code, you need to make your own code or contact our team to run the STT model. Also the code that uses STT model requires the activation of venv.
Other codes are some of our codes that we used while developing our robot. Some of it has explained in the error board of our evidence document that we submitted.
This is for academic submition.
